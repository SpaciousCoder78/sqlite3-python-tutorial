# SQLite3-python-tutorial
A tutorial designed to introduce you to SQlite 3 database using python
# What is SQLite?
SQLite is an in-process library that implements a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional SQL database engine. It is a database, which is zero-configured, which means like other databases you do not need to configure it in your system.

SQLite engine is not a standalone process like other databases, you can link it statically or dynamically as per your requirement with your application. SQLite accesses its storage files directly.
# Why SQLite?
1. Easier to use
2. Doesn't need a server like MySQL
3. It's a built in db software in Python
